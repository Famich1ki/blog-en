Hello everybody!
Welcome to my website, and thank you for discovering it and showing interest.

The purpose of creating this website is to record and share the knowledge and experiences I’ve gathered through my studies.

The first time I deployed this website was when I was a graduate student at NUS in 2024. Since then, I have graduated and moved to Tokyo to start a new chapter in my life.

Indeed, the journey of learning to code has not been easy. I’ve encountered thousands of challenges, each of which left me feeling frustrated. But guess what? Now, I’m even passionate about coding! Sometimes, when you solve a difficult problem on your own, it's a sweet moment you’ll never forget, don’t you think?

In today’s fast-paced world, things change so quickly. I always feel left behind if I don’t learn something new for a while.

As I mentioned on the homepage, "Life's simple, you make choices and don’t look back." This is actually a quote from Han in Fast and Furious.

Keep going my friends. I’ll always be there for you.
